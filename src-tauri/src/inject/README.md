# The page script

fMess runs one script in the Messenger page (and in the call windows it opens,
and in a theme's chat pop-ups, frames of the page: `IN_POPUP`, see 01-start),
before the page's own scripts. It is written here in parts, one per concern, that
share one function's scope: `build.rs` joins every `.js` file in file-name order
into `inject.js`, which `webview.rs` puts in the page. So a part can use what an
earlier part declares, and the numbers set that order.

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| 01-start | Opens the script's function; debug listener log; `withRoot` |
| 02-splash | fMess's loading screen in place of Facebook's |
| 03-facebook-modules | Adjusts a few of Facebook's own modules as they load; Close in call windows |
| 04-privacy | Block Typing (fMess Settings) |
| 05-messenger-prefs | Loads Facebook modules on demand; Messenger's Preferences for the Settings window |
| 06-routes | The chats' route and its marks on `<html>`; the cursor in the message box; links |
| 07-layout | Layout closer to the old desktop app; the strip under the window buttons |
| 08-panes | Resizable chat list and details |
| 09-marks | `data-fmess-ui` marks for themes, found without the page's language |
| 10-selection | What can be selected; Select All; spell check in fields (Settings); a copied image pastes as the image |
| 11-scrollbars | Overlay scroll bars |
| 12-viewer | The photo/video viewer: its buttons and zoom |
| 13-shortcuts | Keyboard shortcuts |
| 14-notifications | Web notifications to the system's, with sender and chat; `say` for fMess's own words |
| 15-unread-badge | The unread count for the Dock and taskbar |
| 16-read-ahead | Reading recent chats ahead so they open at once |
| 17-theme-hooks | Buttons, search box, quick reactions, nav and chat pop-ups themes can ask for |
| 18-notification-reply | Clicks on notifications and replying from them |
| 19-account | Your picture and the account menu |
| 20-theme | The theme picked in Settings; settings from fMess; closes the function |

The joined script is the same text the single file was; `node
tests/notification-reply.mjs` joins the parts the same way. To check the
script's syntax: `cat src-tauri/src/inject/*.js | node --check`
